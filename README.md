Pytorch implementation of Emotions generation with VAE using EmoV-DB.

- The idea behind this project is to build a machine learning model that could generate more samples of voiced emotions.
- Using the pre-trained model you could use both the latent vector of your voice for classification and for generation a new sample which sounds similar to your voice by using the reparametrization trick.
